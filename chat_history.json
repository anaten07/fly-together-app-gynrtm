Ensure these colors are consistently used throughout the app.\n2.  **Logo Integration:**\n    *   Ensure the logo is correctly placed in the app.\n    *   Consider using the logo's shape or elements as inspiration for design details like button styles, card backgrounds, or loading animations.\n3.  **Sleek Design Elements:**\n    *   Incorporate more whitespace to create a cleaner and more modern look.\n    *   Use typography that complements the logo and color scheme. Consider using a modern, sans-serif font for headings and a readable font for body text.\n    *   Refine the `Button.tsx` component to offer a \"Fly Encore\" branded button style.\n4.  **Component Styling:**\n    *   Update the `PilotCard.tsx` component to reflect the new color scheme and sleek design.\n    *   Adjust the `MapView.tsx` component to fit the overall aesthetic, possibly using orange markers or a custom map style.\n5.  **Review and Refine:**\n    *   Thoroughly review each screen and component to ensure consistency and visual appeal.\n    *   Pay attention to details like icon colors, shadow styles, and gradient directions.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-08-03T19:25:59.253617"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you redesign the app to be more sleek and align with your logo using a black, white, and orange color scheme.

This indicates a problem during the compilation or bundling process.\n2.  **Identify Potential Causes:** Compile errors in React Native/Expo projects can stem from various issues, including:\n\n    *   **Syntax Errors:** Typos, incorrect imports, or invalid JavaScript/TypeScript syntax.\n    *   **Module Resolution Issues:** Problems with finding or loading required modules.\n    *   **Type Errors:** TypeScript errors due to incorrect type annotations or usage.\n    *   **Metro Bundler Configuration:** Incorrect or outdated Metro bundler settings.\n    *   **Expo Version Incompatibilities:** Issues arising from using incompatible versions of Expo packages.\n3.  **Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n    *   **Review Recent Changes:** Carefully examine the code changes made recently, as these are the most likely source of the errors.\n    *   **Check for Syntax Errors:** Use a linter or code editor to identify any syntax errors in your code.\n    *   **Verify Module Imports:** Ensure that all required modules are correctly imported and that the import paths are accurate.\n    *   **Address TypeScript Errors:** If you're using TypeScript, pay close attention to any type errors reported by the compiler.\n    *   **Clear Expo Cache:** Sometimes, clearing the Expo cache can resolve bundling issues. You can do this by running `expo start -c` in your project directory.\n    *   **Update Expo Packages:** Make sure that all your Expo packages are up to date. You can update them by running `expo upgrade` in your project directory.\n    *   **Restart the Expo Server:** Try restarting the Expo development server to see if that resolves the issue.\n4.  **Iterative Approach:** I will start by examining the code for common errors and then proceed with more advanced troubleshooting steps if necessary.\n5.  **Requesting File Access:** To effectively diagnose and fix these errors, I will need to examine your project's code. I will start by requesting access to key files such as `app/index.tsx`, `app/pilot/[id].tsx`, `components/Button.tsx`, and any other files that have been recently modified.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-08-03T19:29:53.204206"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix the runtime compilation errors in your Fly Encore app. Let me first examine the current code to identify the issues."}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/Button.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/pilot/[id].tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I can see the issue!
